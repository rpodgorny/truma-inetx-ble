"""Shared Bluetooth resolution for the Truma iNet X panel.

The panel uses a rotating Resolvable Private Address, so a stored MAC goes
stale. Both the live session (coordinator) and the onboarding bond (config
flow) must find and connect the panel THE SAME way — through a remote/proxy
scanner — so the bond lands where the integration will actually connect. This
module is the single source of that resolution.

    Matches the panel by its stable advertised ``name`` OR primary service UUID
    (the local name is absent from add-device/pairing adverts), picks the
    freshest advertised RPA, and returns ONLY a device reachable through a
    remote (proxy) scanner — local host adapters cannot maintain a rotating-RPA
    link (BlueZ pairs but can't reconnect) and would steal the connection from
    the proxy. Returns ``None`` when no proxy route is available right now (the
    caller should retry).

    The "resolved identity" pseudo-address (whose last bytes match the name
    suffix, e.g. ``...FFB4D1``) is excluded — connecting it dials a stale cached
    bonded RPA rather than the live one.

    ``avoid`` is a set of RPA addresses to skip. This exists because of a
    specific, observed failure mode after pairing:

    Right after the bond, the panel keeps *advertising* the RPA it paired on
    but stops *accepting connections* on it (a panel-side phantom from the
    pairing hand-off), while it simultaneously advertises a fresh, live RPA.
    Both addresses look equally valid here — same name, both connectable via the
    proxy, near-identical timestamps — but connecting the dead one fails
    forever with ESP_GATT_CONN_FAIL_ESTABLISH (0x3e). Without ``avoid`` we
    always return the same first candidate and the coordinator hammers the dead
    address indefinitely, leaving the device "unavailable" until someone
    power-cycles the panel. The coordinator feeds back each address that failed
    to establish so we rotate to the panel's other advertised RPA instead.
